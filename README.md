# Understanding Ticks, Prices and Storage

## Basic Price Relationship
x = token 0
y = token 1
p = price of x in terms of y = y/x
p = 1.0001^tick * decimals0/decimals1

## Tick and Price Explanation
Each tick represents a 0.01% (1.0001x) price increase from the previous tick. 
For example:
- Tick 0: Base price (adjusted for token decimals)
- Tick 1: Price is 1.0001x higher than tick 0
- Tick 100: Price is (1.0001)^100 higher than tick 0

tick spacing = number of ticks to skip when the price moves
- Lower tick spacing (e.g., 1): More granular prices, higher gas costs
- Higher tick spacing (e.g., 60): Less granular prices, lower gas costs

Example: In a USDC/ETH pool
- At tick 0: price = 1.0001^0 * (10^6/10^18) = 10^-12
- At tick 202719: price â‰ˆ 2000 USDC per ETH

## sqrtPriceX96
X = token 0
Y = token 1
p = price of X in terms of Y = Y/X
p = (sqrtPriceX96 / 2^96)^2 * (decimalsX / decimalsY)
sqrtPriceX96 = sqrt(p) * 2^96

## Store Tick into Bitmap
The bitmap structure efficiently stores initialized ticks:

1. Word Position (16 bits):
   - Calculated as: tick >> 8 (divide by 256)
   - Maps to storage slot in tick bitmap
   - Each word stores 256 ticks

2. Bit Position (8 bits):
   - Calculated as: tick & 0xFF (remainder of tick/256)
   - Position within the 256-bit word
   - 1 = initialized tick, 0 = uninitialized

Example for tick 12345:
- Word position = 12345 >> 8 = 48
- Bit position = 12345 & 0xFF = 57
- Stored in word 48, bit 57 of bitmap

Benefits:
- Gas-efficient tick tracking
- Compact storage representation
- Fast next tick lookup
- Minimal state updates

## Contract Architecture

### Core Contracts

1. **LetSwapPool.sol**
   - Central pool contract
   - Manages liquidity positions
   - Executes swaps
   - Tracks global state
   ```solidity
   struct Slot0 {
       uint160 sqrtPriceX96;  // Current sqrt price
       int24 tick;            // Current tick
       bool unlocked;         // Reentrancy lock
   }
   ```

2. **Position Management**
   - Tracks individual positions
   - Manages fees per position
   - Handles liquidity updates
   ```solidity
   struct Info {
       uint128 liquidity;
       uint256 feeGrowthInside0LastX128;
       uint256 feeGrowthInside1LastX128;
       uint128 tokensOwed0;
       uint128 tokensOwed1;
   }
   ```

### Math Libraries

1. **SqrtPriceMath.sol**
   - Computes price updates during swaps
   - Calculates token amounts
   - Handles rounding directions

2. **SwapMath.sol**
   - Computes swap steps
   - Calculates fees
   - Determines price impacts

3. **TickMath.sol**
   - Converts between ticks and prices
   - Enforces tick bounds
   - Handles tick spacing

## Key Operations

### Swap Execution
1. Input validation
2. Current price and liquidity check
3. Compute next tick crossing
4. Calculate amounts and fees
5. Update pool state
6. Transfer tokens

### Liquidity Provision
1. Validate tick range
2. Compute required token amounts
3. Transfer tokens to pool
4. Update position
5. Update tick bitmap

### Fee Collection
1. Calculate fees earned
2. Update fee growth trackers
3. Transfer fees to recipient

## Concentrated Liquidity Mechanics

![Liquidity Distribution](/assets/image.png)

Traditional AMM (V2):
- Liquidity spread across entire range
- Capital inefficiency
- Constant product formula: x * y = k

Concentrated Liquidity (V3):
- Liquidity focused in specific ranges
- Higher capital efficiency
- Virtual reserves per tick range

## Implementation Considerations

### Gas Optimization
- Bitmap for tick tracking
- Square root price for calculations
- Efficient fee accounting

### Safety Measures
- Reentrancy protection
- Overflow/underflow checks
- Price bound validation

### Edge Cases
- Zero liquidity handling
- Price range boundaries
- Fee precision

## Technical Insights

1. **Price Representation**
   - Using square root prices reduces multiplication complexity
   - Q64.96 format balances precision and range
   - Tick system provides deterministic price points

2. **Position Management**
   - Each position tracks its own fee growth
   - Liquidity can be added/removed independently
   - Positions can overlap

3. **Swap Routing**
   - Swaps can cross multiple tick boundaries
   - Each crossing requires recalculation
   - Fee computation per step
